# Project Express API

The assignment was to install and set up an Express server, deploy Node and filtering data. Here it is done with an JSON file with golden globe stats. 

## The problem

Some of the filters are not working the way I want to, and that is someting I want to work more on. When i discoverd this i tried different aproaches, since the movies does not have an uniqe ID, find() does not work. Also the else does not work. This is problems i want to fix and will do when i have more time. Tools i used where postman.
